    <ReviewText> It's a classic case where many problems outweigh few pluses and a stylized, cool by definition premise gets utterly destroyed by an incredibly short, substance-free kind of gameplay that ranges from frustrating to idiotic. </ReviewText>

    <ReviewText> Adr1ft doesn't pioneer any new types of gameplay with VR, which is a shame because it desperately needs some variety in that area. However, it does benefit greatly from blocking off the rest of the world, creating a feeling of isolation that aligns with what your character is experiencing. Floating out over the Earth and looking down from this perspective is truly impressive. [VR Tested] </ReviewText>

No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem...It is one of the very best video games ever made. </ReviewText>

    <ReviewText> In nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG Ive always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. Its certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldnt come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me. </ReviewText>

    <ReviewText> Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania with a well of content to discover thats as deep as its labyrinthine caves. The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story thats left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it. With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, its worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight. </ReviewText>

    <ReviewText> The PC version of Unity requires a pretty hefty rig to run, and an even heftier one is recommended. That said, those of you who have access to this will find that Unity on PC looks even better than its console brethren thanks to being able to run at resolutions above 900p, enhanced textures, and (hardware permitting) a much higher frame rate than the locked 30fps of the Xbox One and PS4. </ReviewText>
