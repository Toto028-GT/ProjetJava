<ReviewText> It's a classic case where many problems outweigh few pluses and a stylized, cool by definition premise gets utterly destroyed by an incredibly short, substance-free kind of gameplay that ranges from frustrating to idiotic. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition is a bold attempt to remaster the most controversial game in a series. The funky experimental RTS at the core of AoE 3 is intact, but it's still just that: Weird. Like a stinky cheese, it just can't appeal to everyone. The new graphics, UI, sound, and content make it much more fun to play and will win converts among those who are trying it for the first time. The rest was harder to update, and though it's better than it was, the single-player scenarios will never be half as fun as multiplayer matches. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Though the camera can cause issues and the supernatural story that's more interested in asking questions than answering them, it's a tough game to put down once you've started. Remedy's done a great job of mixing elements of written work, television, and videogames to create an experience full of scares, laughs, and thrills that's just as fun to play as it is to watch. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> While the original AO Tennis may have launched with enough squandered potential to make even Nick Kyrgios shake his head, AO Tennis 2 has taken a major stride forward to more closely resemble an Ash Barty-style all-rounder. It could yet benefit from more balancing and bug fixing post-release, but as it stands AO Tennis 2 is the best videogame simulation of the sport in years. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> When Im having a good time in ARK, Im having a really good time. The problem is that those moments are usually one part to every nine parts menial grinding and crafting - especially at the later tech tiers. Having to repeat so much work after failing an attempt at a boss feels far too punishing, and some really dumb dinosaurs can take a lot of the challenge and sense of danger out of the many primal locations. Even with all of those quirks, however, Im still hungry to play more after the 60 hours Ive spent so far. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> The PC version of Unity requires a pretty hefty rig to run, and an even heftier one is recommended. That said, those of you who have access to this will find that Unity on PC looks even better than its console brethren thanks to being able to run at resolutions above 900p, enhanced textures, and (hardware permitting) a much higher frame rate than the locked 30fps of the Xbox One and PS4. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Even with the satisfying creative freedom of its Infiltrations and the brisk bite that scythes add to combat, The Siege of Paris doesnt feel like an essential addition to Assassins Creed Valhalla. Its story provides a truly memorable menace in King Charles, but otherwise doesnt stand out much from what weve already seen, substituting Breton soldiers with Frankish ones. Valhalla of course remains fun on its own merits, but the base adventure already has Mjolonirs weight in nearly identical content. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Battlefield 4 is an excellent multiplayer game that makes the most of its ambitions, proving once again that destruction is a valuable strategic addition to competitive combat, which reaches its full potential with two killer Commanders are bringing out the best in their squads. On the other hand, its single-player campaign is a disappointing. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> There is art here, despite what many would say isn't possible with games, from Roger Ebert to game designers like Hideo Kojima... BioShock stands as a monolithic example of the convergence of entertaining gameplay and an irresistibly sinister, engrossing storyline that encompasses a host of multifaceted characters. This is an essential gaming experience. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Call of Duty: WW2 offers a surprisingly fast-paced and fun World War II experience. The campaign features a more personal story, while the new War multiplayer mode alleviates some of my frustrations with the generally small multiplayer maps. Of all the parts, though, Nazi Zombies is a standout with its wonderfully creepy setting and puzzle-like tasks. Its mostly what youd expect from a great Call of Duty game, and a near-miss for a spot in the lineup of top Call of Duty games. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> I am having a ton of fun with Chivalry 2. The maps, outside of a few balance issues, are a total blast  everything from the shining armor to the soaring castle walls looks great and there are a huge range of objectives to keep things interesting. Whether I'm swinging a sword or plucking away with a bow, combat hits that elusive sweet spot between accessible dumb fun and rewarding, skill-based mechanics where the wheat is separated from the chaff. When you respawn and everyone around you is spamming the battle cry button as you rush headlong into certain death, you just know you're in for a rockin' time. I don't think I'll be putting away this sweaty coat of mail for a good while. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Crusader Kings 3 is a superb strategy game, a great RPG, and a master class in how to take the best parts of existing systems and make them deeper and better. I have thousands of hours in the previous game, and I expect to spend at least that many in this third installment. All of the engrossingly flawed characters and stories of love, war, triumph, and loss that have already dynamically emerged from my playthroughs feel like just the beginning of something legendary. In fact, if I had to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life, the decision wouldnt be that difficult. A new king of historical strategy has been crowned. Long live the king. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Cyberpunk 2077 kicks you into its beautiful and dazzlingly dense cityscape with few restrictions. It offers a staggering amount of choice in how to build your character, approach quests, and confront enemies, and your decisions can have a tangible and natural-feeling impact on both the world around you and the stories of the people who inhabit it. Those stories can be emotional, funny, dark, exciting, and sometimes all of those things at once. The main quest may be shorter than expected when taken on its own and its not always clear what you need to do to make meaningful changes to its finale, but the multitude of side quests available almost from the start can have a surprisingly powerful effect on the options you have when you get there. Its a shame that frustratingly frequent bugs can occasionally kill an otherwise well-set mood, but Cyberpunk 2077s impressively flexible design makes it a truly remarkable RPG. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> If Dark Souls 3 truly is the last in the series as we know it, then its a worthy send-off. Weapon arts allow stylish and versatile new moves without tarnishing the purity of the combat system. Lothrics awe-inspiring locations provide visually stunning arenas for rigorous exploration and fierce face-offs with hosts of deadly enemies and even deadlier bosses. While not all the risky changes land as neatly as others, Dark Souls 3 is a powerful journey and the sequel the series truly deserves. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> In an effort to do everything, Fallout 76 fails to do any of it well enough to form an identity. Its multiplayer mindset robs its quests of all the moral decisionmaking that makes the series great, and all thats left is a buggy mess of systemic designs that never seems to work together and regularly contradicts itself. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Ultimately, FIFA 18 introduces enough new ideas to suggest its not sitting on the laurels of its success. However, its a simplified experience, one that fails to embrace the complexity of football at the highest level. Its focus on attack makes for spectacular matches, but they often feel like extravagant offensive training sessions than a proper match with depth and strategy. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But its hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> H1Z1 checks all of the boxes needed to be a competent battle royale game, but in its main mode it lacks a distinctive sense of character. Without the realistic depth and modular weaponry of PUBG or the wacky base-building antics of Fortnite, its streamlined design rushes toward straightforward, fast-paced action instead and ends up being dull as often as it is exciting. The more interesting thing about H1Z1 is its innovative Auto Royale mode, which translates battle royale mechanics to vehicular combat in a way we havent seen done better elsewhere. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is a superb instalment of IOs idiosyncratic but much-loved stealth series. The fundamentals havent changed since 2016 but its collection of outstanding maps makes for a refined, reliable, and robust curtain-closer to the current Hitman trilogy. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> In nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG Ive always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. Its certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldnt come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania with a well of content to discover thats as deep as its labyrinthine caves. The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story thats left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it. With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, its worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> If all you want is 60 FPS and you have a relatively recent system and a sufficiently fast GPU for your target resolution, that should be easy enough to achieve as long as you take note of the settings and configuration requirements I pointed out in the performance deep dive section. However, chasing consistent very high framerates above that (e.g. 120 FPS) seems like a fools errand even on top-end hardware. Ultimately the game is a visual spectacle and the gameplay is not particularly fast-paced, so the severe sacrifices in graphics necessary to achieve even relatively consistent 120 FPS do not appear to be worth it in this case. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> But sometimes it feels like League of Legends throws too much at the player, both in terms of the number of champions and the general confusion of the larger battles. While that's not enough to dampen your enthusiasm of the game, the vague status of the launch and the more-than-occasional hostility of the community just might. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Mafia 3s strong characters and confident storytelling kept me engaged, even if the gameplay rarely delivered anything but bog-standard and repetitive open-world action. Thats a bummer, because Lincoln is an incredible protagonist and New Bordeaux is a fantastic setting thematically, and it wouldve been great to see them put to better use. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Mafia II is an interesting mobster tale with some great voice acting and cool cutscenes; if you have a "made man" itch, feel free to scratch it here, but be prepared for a pretty standard third-person shooter in the gameplay department. The "take cover, kill everyone, do it again" mechanic didn't wow me, but it didn't let me down either. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Microsoft Flight Simulator is legitimately incredible. It's difficult to fully describe how amazing it feels to jump into a plane and have the freedom fly to and from literally any place in the entire world. The base game's 20 included aircraft feel like more than enough for even hardcore aviation enthusiasts, and the ability to adjust the assists to tailor the experience to whatever skill level you desire makes it suitable for anyone looking to fly the friendly skies from the comfort of their home. The real-world mapping data, however, takes Microsoft Flight Simulator from being just an impressive game to the most awe-inspiring simulation I've ever experienced, in spite of its less than stellar load times. Seeing famous landmarks, landing at the world's most recognizable airports, or just touching down in a remote landing strip in South America is mind-bogglingly cool and an absolutely unparalleled way to virtually explore our world. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Overwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play. When youre at the center of it, it feels like nothing else. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> With so many interconnected systems, from the farm simulation to simple combat and cooking to crafting, and each driving the others forward in some way, its a deeper and more complex game than youd expect after the first day on the farm. Theres plenty to do while I wait to uncover more of the Valleys secrets, and the prospect of filling my days with new adventures or just a better harvest is too enticing to pass up. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Subnautica is a template for what open-world survival games should strive to be. Its fantastical, fresh, and frightening from surface to seabed, with a story that kept on surprising me and a cast of sea monsters that quite literally haunted my dreams. Even with more than 50 hours sunk, I have yet to discover all of its secrets. Its a testament to how enticing those secrets are that Im willing to face my fears and plunge my submersible into the darkest corners of its unforgiving ocean again and again. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Its strong character progression and combat systems better suit the offline Elder Scrolls games than in most MMOs, but its very much a game about adventuring with other players. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Its a clever game thats not afraid to be challenging, and a very enjoyable puzzle if you dont mind it also being a touch vague, often repetitive, and happy to quickly get as hard as figuring out an actual prison break. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> This huge, wide-open shooter constantly shows its flaws in its mission variety and vehicle physics, but its strong, sandbox-style gameplay and seamless co-op kept me coming back for more madness. If you must repeat experiences over and over, you could far worse than helicopter chases, assassination missions, or drug busts gone wildly wrong. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Trackmanias mechanically nuanced time trials are as tense and addictive in 2020 as they were in 2006. The initial content selection of this latest entry is robust and a wealth of entertaining custom tracks are potentially just a click away as long as both you and the community of talented track creators are willing to pay for its yearly subscription, that is. The idea that youll have to rebuy this version of Trackmania annually raises very real concerns about its longevity, but right now at least, it offers a well-modernized (if not revolutionary) take on a uniquely entertaining racing experience that threw out the rulebook years ago. </ReviewText>

<ReviewText> Valorant is the most fun I've had with a multiplayer FPS since Valve's Team Fortress 2. The flexibility of its magically-infused cast paired with a deep arsenal makes for a magnificent competitive canvas, if a tricky one to initially pick up. I'm already pondering new strategies to pull off with my friends in the future, and that joyous daydreaming won't stop anytime soon. It may not be the prettiest modern FPS around, but its visual simplicity enables excellent clarity in every fight. With its teeth sunk in this deep, Valorant makes me want to keep playing until there's nothing left to master. </ReviewText>
