The new graphics, UI, sound, and content make it much more fun to play and will win converts among those who are trying it for the first time.

And the faster pace of its very strong campaign mechanics and pretty good tactical battles make it feel like I can write a new chapter of this saga in a reasonable amount of time and still have time to do something else on my day off  especially with the very well-done story realms. Cranking all the dials up to maximum weirdness can lead to some edge cases that ruined my fun a bit, but it's not that big of a price to pay for the vast map and empire customization we get to play with.

And it still probably is. Borrowing from some of the greatest squad-based tactics games and adding its own twists, I don't think I've played anything that really gets what was so cool about Aliens, the film, since Monolith's Aliens Versus Predator 2 way back in 2001. And many have tried! It's the sort of game that makes me wish I could look the other way and praise it even higher, but on balance, I just can't. With a few weeks in the med bay for a bit of extra technical polish, it could shine up nicely into something amazing. As-is, it's still an intriguing, inspired, imaginative survival RTS that I can enthusiastically recommend, but only with some caveats. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Aliens_ Fireteam Elite</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/f5240b269f735a7b55c1db6d07baa0c2-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Aug-21</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Cold Iron Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Third-Person,Tactical</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>69.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Aliens : Fireteam's gameplay needs to be perfected to really be enjoyed in the long term, but fans of the double-jawed beast can wait with some great story and atmosphere.

The areas where it clicks strike an excellent balance of problem solving and pure adrenaline, even if some of the later sections drag due to uninteresting puzzles and infrequent ghoul tussles.

The larger story it was building has already been played out with Rebirth. But Amnesia: The Bunker proves that smaller, anthology-style episodes within its universe can still bring the tension and the scares. And Frictional's bag of tricks is far from exhausted when it comes to getting our hearts pounding and making us carefully consider how to use the limited tools available to us. It's not an unmissable experience, but as an Amnesia fan, it definitely sated my appetite for some gut-churning horror and moody, bleak storytelling. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Amnesia_ The Dark Descent</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/7ad8341a5c9286d75d8776cdb2122f66-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>8-Sep-10</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Frictional Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Horror,Horror,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  This is one of the scariest games in recent memory. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Among the Sleep</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/38e17bf4d84c1e07913807c230a08619-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>29-May-14</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Krillbite Studio </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Modern,Adventure,3D,First-Person,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>66.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>73.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Its story is sparse and the impact of its conclusion isnt fully worked through, yet its worth playing for the way in which it manipulates perspective and transforms everyday locations into nightmarish reflections. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Among Us VR</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/3afc9db5adcad1fdd44a09dbf327d3cb-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>10-Nov-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Schell Games, Innersloth </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>82.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Among Us VR is a strong remake of Innersloths social deduction hit.

An unwieldy plot and less than amazing script show that if the project was missing one thing, it was probably an editor. But none of that stopped me from thoroughly enjoying all the things it did well. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Anomaly 2</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/0b4a0fb34f894d7182935e7d657f1b72-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>15-May-13</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>11 bit studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Strategy,General,Real-Time,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,General</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation4,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>77.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The addition of its innovative competitive asymmetrical multiplayer is the big draw here  as long as everyone takes the time to learn the complex rules, that is. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Anomaly_ Warzone Earth</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/8c77fbcef58e0a4714e9aa37aa954872-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>8-Apr-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>11 bit studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,General,Sci-Fi,General</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>80.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  A clever twist on tower defense that will rope back in gamers that think they've had enough of the well-worn formula. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Anthem</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/c82ce44d5a10c16621543ce704eaffe5-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>22-Feb-19</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>BioWare </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionRPG</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>59.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>65.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Anthem has energetic combat but it saves too much of what precious little content it has for the endgame, making playing through its mismatched story a tediously repetitive grind. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Antichamber</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/b95c49f89d28f6b395ea227d034560aa-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>31-Jan-13</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Demruth </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Miscellaneous,Puzzle,General,Puzzle,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>82.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>86.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Antichamber has some of the more clever puzzles of any game I've played.

Its beautiful world, excellent combat, great interface, and straightforward but detailed story come together to form something spectacular. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Ashen</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/3d330950ee49502a5f50e870e2ad9303-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>6-Dec-18</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>A44 </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionAdventure,ActionRPG,Open-World</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>81.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Ashens handful of new ideas make it a stellar Souls-like with solid combat, a great art style, and an interesting world.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Asheron's Call 2_ Fallen Kings</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/066ebc7c00eb938b9316c03d8beec6f3-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Nov-02</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Turbine Inc. </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,MassivelyMultiplayerOnline,MassivelyMultiplayer,Fantasy,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>82.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  What awaits everyone in Dereth is a world rich with lore, quests and beauty. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Asheron's Call Dark Majesty</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/b4c14bb6488830615c9aa862f6c24a93-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>4-Nov-01</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Turbine Inc. </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,MassivelyMultiplayerOnline,MassivelyMultiplayer,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>80.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>84.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Though a few problems presented itself initially, Asherons Call: Dark Majesty has lived up to its hype and is a wonderful addition to the game. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Asheron's Call</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/7d673b84eb4a582c13db61a5665ccf11-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>31-Oct-99</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Turbine Inc. </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,MassivelyMultiplayerOnline,MassivelyMultiplayer,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>81.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>64.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Nearly everything that's good about this game is colored by some sort of flaw.

Its full of charming character designs and the occasional hint of a clever idea, but its insistence on being a one-button game with dozens of needlessly overlapping abilities that are thrown aside just as fast as they are introduced rots it to the core. Its a mess of undercooked concepts and clunky mechanics that slow it to a crawl, and it seems to take inspiration from better games without properly recapturing what actually makes them fun. Its platforming never evolves beyond the most basic possible obstacles it can throw at you, but it's the fundamentally flawed choices behind that mediocrity that take Balan Wonderworld from unamusing to outright bad. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Baldur's Gate 3</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/731084884851e13be0d8e6c91c99d4ff-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>3-Aug-23</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Larian Studios Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation5,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>96.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>100.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Larian perfects its own formula for Baldur's Gate's return and delivers the best CRPG around for veteran and newcomers.

The fluid mouse-and-WASD-driven combat makes every move count and the quick pace of its 10-minute matches never lets off the gas. Even with its lackluster randomized progression system robbing it of momentum, Battlerite keeps me coming back to improve and add to my bag of tricks along the way. Stunlocks approach to MOBA combat creates a near-even playing field that makes each outplay feel earned, whether it was me or my foe picking up the win. These arenas are places I can see myself brawling for a long time to come. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Battleship_ Surface Thunder</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/37a5fe3f83579768d8ccca8ad21f35b4-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>15-Oct-00</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Meyer / Glass Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Miscellaneous,General,General,Board/CardGame</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>65.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>0</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>74.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The trite design mentality glorified by this product will preclude stuffier members of the public from appreciating its finer virtues, but screw the tightwads. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Battlestar Galactica</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/8af5eec952731797d42afdb288047e64-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>23-Oct-07</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Auran </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,Third-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>45.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>51.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  This is a waste of a property that could be great game fare. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Battlestations_ Midway</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/eba65b146abd3bf483c3c9bd2db73b81-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Jan-07</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Eidos Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Historic,General,Historic</Genre><Platforms>Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>76.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  While the online options are thin, this game offers a great one-on-one option for RTS fans as well as a great co-op experience for those that have paid their dues on the training modes.

What it lacks in originality with its design it more than makes up for with its bizarre world, appalling story, and inspired look and sound. The new weapons and focus on platforming definitely helped sustain my enjoyment for the campaigns sizable duration, even when underwhelming enemy variety and unchallenging bosses leave something to be desired. Its stomach-churning religious torture porn might be as far as you can get from the adorable world of Hollow Knight, but youd be hard-pressed to find something better to play while you continue your interminable wait for Silksong. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Blazing Angels 2_ Secret Missions of WWII</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/90adfca22295dbce09624ef5a674b816-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>21-Sep-07</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Ubisoft Romania </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Simulation,Flight,WWII,WWII,Combat</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>72.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Blazing Angels 2's shortcomings are few and far between, and while the better-late-than-never checkpoint system is the most aggravating of all, the game is still a great deal of fun, especially online.

The fact that it is Blood Bowl 3 is not obvious, as it feels like a simple remaster. Even worse, we are leaving a previous episode better balanced and with more teams than this one. Of course, the customization can bring a real pleasure and an even greater investment in our teams (if it does not gradually become only governed by the virtual currency of the game). There is no doubt that the title will become more interesting as the months go by with real patches, team additions and so on. It is still difficult to recommend Blood Bowl 3 for the moment, as it struggles to offer a sufficiently technically accomplished title. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Blood Bowl III</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/490055700d7ed50bd5f5c31e4ff4daa5-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>23-Feb-23</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Cyanide </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Sports,Team,Football,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>57.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>1.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>50.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  As someone who enjoys the tactical action of Blood Bowl, I can easily recommend you go pick up Blood Bowl 2 Legendary Edition and have a gorey good time with it. As for Blood Bowl 3, though, I struggle to come up with a reason it needs to exist other than that someone has bills to pay, I guess. There's less reason to recommend it over its predecessor than an especially weak year of Madden or NBA 2K. It's a sloppy, muddy, buggy rehash of a better game. Sure, the strong core mechanics can still lead to some tense, exhilarating matches, but you could have all of that with a much sharper presentation in the version that came out during the Obama Administration. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Blood Bowl</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/77359ffdbd34ccf39811048eb165dc6f-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>25-Jun-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Cyanide </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Sports,Alternative,Team,Individual,Football,Other,Other,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>72.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>64.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Blood Bowl is a respectable attempt at bringing the ideals of a board game to a videogame.

The maps, outside of a few balance issues, are a total blast  everything from the shining armor to the soaring castle walls looks great and there are  a huge range of objectives to keep things interesting. Whether I'm swinging a sword or plucking away with a bow, combat hits that elusive sweet spot between accessible dumb fun and rewarding, skill-based mechanics where the wheat is separated from the chaff. When you respawn and everyone around you is spamming the battle cry button as you rush headlong into certain death, you just know you're in for a rockin' time. I don't think I'll be putting away this sweaty coat of mail for a good while. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Chivalry_ Medieval Warfare</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/4920c7f621d0a6dd72c40c43f09db64a-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>16-Oct-12</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Torn Banner Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Strategy,General,General,General,Beat-'Em-Up,3D</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,PlayStation4,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>79.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>79.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Like its competition, Chivalry hasn't quite perfected the formula for medieval warfare, but it's a violent, fun time nonetheless. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Choplifter HD</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/b953e9f4d329dfa27a427800786d4f72-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>11-Jan-12</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>InXile Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,General,Shooter,Shooter,Scrolling,Scrolling,Shoot-'Em-Up,Vertical</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>65.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The only notable feature unique to the PC version of Choplifter HD is its spotty mouse controls.

Its large and pretty map is filled with fleshed-out side quests, and theyre varied enough that its easy to cruise around for a few dozen hours and really get the hang of the combat system. The story behind it all isnt half bad once youve waded through a flood of sci-fi mysticism, and Nara and Forsaken are interesting characters to spend all that time with  which is a relief, because theyre the only ones we ever get to see.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Chris Sawyer's Locomotion</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/368191f599f0555f4e06de0b57e0348b-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>9-Sep-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Chris Sawyer </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Tycoon,Management,Tycoon,Business/Tycoon</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>59.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>58.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  With a lack of presentation values, an engine that not only looks bad but also is the main cause of serious construction problems, and AI that could use a serious overhaul, Locomotion has too many problems for any serious recommendation. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Chrome</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/ef40970df43c07e0914bbe2ab0fc0730-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>28-Oct-03</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Techland </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>69.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>79.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  This one's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something a little different in the FPS realm, but I'll warn you not to base the game off of the demo level because it isn't really a great representation of the game. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Chronicles of Mystery_ The Scorpio Ritual</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/ed5bb48080f4ea5c1b6aca25bf59a575-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>14-Nov-08</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>City Interactive, Navarre Corp </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,General,General,Point-and-Click</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>62.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>75.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  After drawing me in and taking me on a whirlwind ride, The Scorpio Ritual left me with nothing but a stunned expression and a heartache the like of which I haven't felt since 2007's Culpa Innata.

 The core of Company of Heroes 3s pair of single-player campaigns is fun, tactical RTS action of the kind the series is well known for. Battles are often spectacular in their use of terrain and the series traditional mix of infantry and armor, and are consistently interesting despite the lackluster AI that loves to blunder its way into an unconvincing defeat. But its campaigns are both wrapped up in big ideas and stories that just dont work out well. A buggy and frustratingly designed dynamic Italian campaign map feels like its just wasting time between the exciting tactical battles it loosely connects, and the North African campaigns strong missions are strung together by loose stories that fail to connect. After the brilliant World War 2 campaigns weve seen from this series in the past, its hard not to be disappointed in these.

I have thousands of hours in the previous game, and I expect to spend at least that many in this third installment. All of the engrossingly flawed characters and stories of love, war, triumph, and loss that have already dynamically emerged from my playthroughs feel like just the beginning of something legendary. In fact, if I had to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life, the decision wouldnt be that difficult. A new king of historical strategy has been crowned. Long live the king. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Crusader Kings II</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/6db1307990a954c85b797bb5e725bd17-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>14-Feb-12</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Paradox Development Studio </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Historic,General,Historic</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>82.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  One of the surprising things about Crusader Kings II is that, for a Paradox title, it's actually relatively easy to pick up.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Crusader Kings</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/1b8da61e24c677849bae0dfe3795c296-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>28-Sep-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Paradox Development Studio </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Historic,General,Historic</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>73.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>76.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The family mechanic definitely adds a lot of much-needed personality to the series. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Cryostasis_ The Sleep of Reason</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/ad86b8415413ae4898a614e4ce88259f-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Apr-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Action Forms Ltd. </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>69.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>60.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The setting is spooky, the time-travel bits are engaging, and the overall vibe scores big in the traditional components of fright.

Its between-run progression systems didnt do much to hook me compared to the simple drive to best its hardest challenges, but even without that carrot on a stick, Curse of the Dead Gods is a blessing in disguise. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Curse of the Dead Gods</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/6e43d72691c567aa50f8950b7e501ea2-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>23-Feb-21</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Passtech Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionRPG</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>78.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Curse of the Dead Gods is a great action roguelite title that let you balance risk with precise control and complex gameplay mechanisms.

Those stories can be emotional, funny, dark, exciting, and sometimes all of those things at once. The main quest may be shorter than expected when taken on its own and its not always clear what you need to do to make meaningful changes to its finale, but the multitude of side quests available almost from the start can have a surprisingly powerful effect on the options you have when you get there. Its a shame that frustratingly frequent bugs can occasionally kill an otherwise well-set mood, but Cyberpunk 2077s impressively flexible design makes it a truly remarkable RPG. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>D-Day</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/fc8ae20f2bb29e472310f2e27d75d09b-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>7-Dec-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Digital Reality </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Historic,General,Historic</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>56.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>52.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The game is just plain boring. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Daemonica</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/b1bd7150528f23898671d5839804f61a-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>31-Mar-06</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Cinemax, RA Images </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,3D,Fantasy,Third-Person,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>65.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Nothing in Daemonica stands out as particularly weak, but aside from the main character traversing into the land of the dead to talk to murder victims, there's little of particular note. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Damnation</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/bad0f27c2867066c6dbe18a3586cb760-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>22-May-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Blue Omega </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,Third-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>41.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>25.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The gameplay isn't fun, the levels are too long, the sound is bad, and the story isn't interesting.

Its inventive and humorous ways to put down the dead are something I still havent tired of, and its surprisingly interesting plot is more than just a zombie-killing delivery system. Despite the technical blemishes that come with the series, its lack of co-op story mode play, and the fun-yet-unreliable multiplayer, Frank Wests return brings the series some fresh ideas, a ton of bloody mayhem, and a whole lot of cracking wise. Heres hoping he sticks around for a while. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Dead Space (2008)</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/e5607b646bccca10bbf1e435451044e6-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Oct-08</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>EA Redwood Shores </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,Third-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>86.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>87.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Call it science fiction survival horror, but Dead Space does the genre proud with an engaging story; action that's tense, fast-paced and extremely violent; as well as atmospheric qualities that will get under your skin and make you jump. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Dead Space 2</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/086dbc6f10fc74f094f22a1cace576ba-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>25-Jan-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Visceral Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,Third-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>87.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The shocking moments, the gruesome deaths, and the fun of playing through this experience again and again are what I took away from this one. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Dead Space 3</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/4149d91657176b530a38f25078849f17-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>5-Feb-13</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Visceral Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,ActionAdventure,Shooter,Shooter,Linear,Third-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>78.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>78.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Considering the elegance and sophistication of the world, combat and upgrade design, its a shame everything else seems so ho-hum. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Dead Space</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/f17a47eb53585a8ba40aa6b862c46851-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>27-Jan-23</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Electronic Arts, Motive Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation5,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>87.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Dead Space is a superb remake and undoubtedly the definitive way to experience one of the best survival horror shooters that Capcom never made. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Dead State</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/d440dec5a5d1283bf3e6acb9c8044df9-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>4-Dec-14</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>DoubleBear Productions </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):General,Role-Playing,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>70.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>68.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Make no mistake: to pull off everything that Dead State tries would be an achievement for any RPG, and its impressive how much it manages.

That said, Strand and the new Tormentor enemy are fantastic new additions to the sandbox, some of the endgame activities and added difficulty make for a sweaty, memorable time, and per usual, the raid is a complete blast (even if it isnt their best). No doubt Lightfalls shortcomings are made more painful by immediately following The Witch Queen and its strong post-launch updates, which felt like Destiny 2 had finally overcome its storytelling woes and charted out a promising future for itself. After playing Lightfall, perhaps too fittingly given its name, that future doesnt look quite as bright. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Destiny 2_ Lightfall</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/dea2b349c077261dd6bd5207c519c6c9-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>28-Feb-23</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Bungie </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,First-Person,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>66.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>2.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>60.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Beautiful and dynamic, but of more than questionable interest, Destiny 2: Eclipse really miss its mark.

It masterfully preserves the mood of a singular game, and at the same time it preserves the gameplay as it has been for over a decade  mostly for better, occasionally for worse.

Few other RPGs allow such a wide range of flexibility while also supporting rewarding combat and a powerful story, all in a world that feels alive in the ways it reacts to you and goes about its business without you. It's a rare RPG that Ill want to play through again and again, driven by the feeling that so many fascinating and surprising paths remain undiscovered, some of which might lead to different outcomes for the NPCs Ive grown to care about  even the rats. When that happens, you're experiencing something worth remembering, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 will be remembered as one of the greats. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Divinity_ Original Sin</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/5b2cc7043d5a7a30a26cdbc7decf663d-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>17-Jan-14</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Larian Studios Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionRPG,Role-Playing,ActionRPG,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>87.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Divinity: Original Sin is one of the most rewarding RPGs to come along in years. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>DmC_ Devil May Cry</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/5830b44386c73d93068d1887328fd6a1-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Jan-13</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Ninja Theory, QLOC </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,General,ActionAdventure,Fantasy,General,Fantasy,Linear</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>89.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Long-time Devil May Cry fans unsure of Ninja Theory's treatment can abandon their fears.

While it is a bummer that you only get to ride that sweet dragon in cutscenes, the new enemies prove to be more fun to fight, the Sentinel Hammer is a blast, and the final boss fight isnt quite as sadistic. Youll still need mastery of every skill Doom has taught you over the past half-decade to make it through this gauntlet, and if this is the end of Eternals story, its been a hell of a ride. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>DOOM Eternal</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/69971550f3485629bc00981fd50465ca-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Mar-20</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>id Software </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,First-Person,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Stadia,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>88.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Whether you're a new Doom fan or a veteran one, Doom Eternal is bound to delight &amp; entertain you.

The single-player campaign's reverent worship of the series' roots results in an old-school run-and-gun shooter which feels like imitation Doom, a cover of an old hit which nails all the right power chords but isn't exactly transformative. The multiplayer's attempts to borrow from the new to reinvigorate the old results in an experience which won't satisfy either school of thought. SnapMap, meanwhile, is a blend of weird and simple and endearing. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Dordogne</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/6c98d69bd66c738c139a84e02e09e241-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>13-Jun-23</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Un Je Ne Sais Quoi </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,General,3D,Third-Person</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>76.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>60.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It is better to know what to expect so as not to be disappointed: Dordogne is a pretty narrative story, which we would have liked a little more open.

This is a game that I envision many people will play and enjoy for a few hours, feel like theyve gotten their fill of it, and then move on to something else. But that will be an incredible shame because theyll never experience Exoprimals best content, which is hidden in the back half of its bonkers sci-fi story, and features some of the most surprising and innovative gameplay moments Ive experienced in a team-based multiplayer game in a long time. I wish it took a little less time to get to those moments, as repetition starts to creep in before they hit, but Exoprimals unique PvPvE formula is impeccably designed, features fun and distinct exosuits regardless of what role you play, and is a breath of fresh air in the multiplayer hero shooter genre. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Expeditions_ Rome</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/1ee0fa32b9a60844e7e56891414125b9-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Jan-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Logic Artists </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Real-Time,General,Strategy,Turn-Based,Tactics</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>80.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Expeditions: Rome deserves a Roman triumph as one of the most impressive tactical RPGs of the last several years, despite occasionally bending under the weight of too many systems. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Extinction</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/6300ba217477b84fe0052b2b051d807b-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>9-Apr-18</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Iron Galaxy Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,General</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>51.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>2.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>66.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Extinction lands in that awkward position where, yeah, its usually fun - but youre not really missing anything incredible by giving it a pass. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>F.E.A.R. 2_ Project Origin</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/f85b2e474be331ee5656608674c75347-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>10-Feb-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Monolith Productions </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Modern,Modern,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>79.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>83.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Its a good shooter, bordering on great at times, but its not as groundbreaking as its predecessor.

The heavy reliance on recycled vignettes and the same old faces weve been seeing for virtually an entire generation admittedly means F1 2020 doesnt necessarily look as fresh as it feels but, between My Team and splitscreen, this is the most fun Ive had with the F1 series for years. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>F1 2021</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/9c01f04da87e86a92fa98e20b387854c-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>16-Jul-21</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Codemasters </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Racing,Simulation,Automobile</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>86.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  F1 2021 is the best-looking and most customisable instalment of series so far and, while it's a little plain, the new story mode is a well-executed and fun new addition. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>F1 23</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/070d51c39fa2645fd35d9e605a529858-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>15-Jun-23</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Codemasters </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Racing,Simulation,Automobile</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>81.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  If F1 23 don't seem to be interested in renewal, the return of Breaking Point and the notable improvements in driving let the games easily get a high score. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>F1 Challenge '99-'02</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/b87a595e7008b848233fa3ef6cb517b0-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Jun-03</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Electronic Arts </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Driving,Racing,Simulation,FormulaOne,FormulaOne,Automobile</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>91.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>95.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  You will have to spend some time practicing and tweaking your opponents, your car handling, and your realism settings to find the right spot for you.

Though the new companion isnt the strongest and the supposedly ruinous radioactive fog is more annoying than threatening, all of the adventuring and new gear absolutely made it worth my while to return to Fallout 4 for Far Harbor. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Fallout 4_ Nuka-World</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/88cf1aaacb28aab84d9e59f7906ffac5-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Aug-16</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Bethesda Game Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>74.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>79.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Nuka-World has a great setting thats densely packed with spectacle, surprises, and tough battles (depending on your level), and the ability to conquer settlements back on the main map is a fun novelty, but the lack of meaningful decisions leave it feeling more like an actual theme park ride than a choose-your-own-adventure story. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Fallout 4</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/499c55b11335a42386dc33fcaefd0ea7-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>9-Nov-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Bethesda Game Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):General,Role-Playing,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>84.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>95.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The world, exploration, crafting, atmosphere, and story of Fallout 4 are all key parts of this hugely successful sandbox role-playing game.

More than all of that though, Ghostrunner is jam packed with a great variety of enemies, mechanics, and special powers that constantly changed up how I approached its many unique encounters. That meant it always felt fresh, and by the end of its six to eight hour campaign, I was all too eager to jump back in for seconds.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Giants_ Citizen Kabuto</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/7a6cd0a7cebf78aef727b4906afa8b4e-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>6-Dec-00</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Planet Moon Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,Third-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>92.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Even with its bugs, Giants is still one of the most creative, innovative, and entertaining games I've played in years. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Gladiators of Rome</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/32bf5bf68f7561883139ebc30acf8814-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>27-Oct-02</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Cat Daddy Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Historic,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>46.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>30.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The game is simply not fun.

Its combat is packed full of decisions to make and a healthy mix of familiar and genuinely novel mechanics, but its Valorplate suits arent as mechanically diverse as they initially seem on their gorgeous exteriors. With neither an interesting story nor a deep pool of varied content, all the choice Godfall offers doesnt amount to much more than a bit of brief and shallow fun. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Gods &amp; Heroes_ Rome Rising</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/904bc695bb8c99bd793ce5f85b2729d2-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>21-Jun-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Heatwave Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,MassivelyMultiplayerOnline,MassivelyMultiplayer,Fantasy,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>50.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>40.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The current game is broken, buggy, and not very fun.

They are at the very least hoisted on their own petard, doing us the favor of digging their own grave or being entertaining in their failures. Gord does not; it simply falls flat and rots where it lies, surrounded by monotonous micromanagement, a poor interface, and by-the-numbers combat. I am content to leave it there, but you may bury it if you like. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Gore_ Ultimate Soldier</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/d008eec56ec382777ce27271100758b5-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>5-Jun-02</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>4D Rulers </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>58.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Its arms, legs, face, and tender cushy butt are all average to the core, but the total package is still cuddly. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Gorogoa</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/d7ae02d8274804027634c60629e4f179-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>14-Dec-17</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Jason Roberts, Buried Signal </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Puzzle,General</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>84.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Gorogoa crafts its inventive, sliding-tile puzzles and magical world with a graceful simplicity across a compact but fulfilling adventure.

There are still glitches, awkward character models, immersion-breaking re-use of assets, and a general bugginess that keep it from being unambiguously excellent, but I have a feeling this is going to be a crowd-pleaser for those of us who still shake our canes and talk about how the genre peaked a decade ago.

Campaigns are short and challenging, making them highly replayable and memorable adventures that reward your time. Its kinda absurd that such an eclectic group of mechanics work together in such harmony, but once youre bitten by their charms its quite hard to put Griftlands down. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Grim Dawn</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/f221af394a8188ee9f5c3b2403145c91-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>25-Feb-16</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Crate Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionRPG,Role-Playing,ActionRPG</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>83.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>87.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Grim Dawn is one of the best action-RPGs out there, combining excellent hack and slash action with a world and progression curve that makes it worth fighting through.

Helpful quality-of-life features like the ability to go back and re-read earlier messages are also as approachable as they are omnipresent. It takes a while to get going, though it also makes familiarizing yourself with its somewhat dense lore easy thanks to a built-in codex that explains most of the in-world jargon required to understand whats going on. But hidden between Reveries magic and metaphors is a story firmly rooted in the power of community, reflecting the resilience of the human spirit itself. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/1a39e8954e3dd0ef44816a3635db2779-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>15-Nov-02</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>KnowWonder </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Fantasy,General,Fantasy,Open-World</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>77.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Potter fans will love this game and anyone hankering for a decent action/adventure that we haven't seen since American McGee's "Alice" may just find this will hold them over until Mr. McGee's next big release. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/fbd49dec682d76d08c8507a478a0a065-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>8-Nov-05</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Electronic Arts </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Fantasy,General,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>66.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>72.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The game's not perfect.

I wish Id just stayed on my own side of the fence. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Hellpoint</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/7c4b45b1dc3585a55ad19176e759601d-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Jul-20</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Cradle Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionRPG</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Stadia,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>64.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>60.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Significant bugs, performance issues, and an almost entirely unoriginal foundation hold Hellpoint back from greatness, but the creepy atmosphere and satisfying combat progression manage to salvage some enjoyment for this sci-fi Souls-like. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Her Story</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/34bb3a2c85c8ec32aff788038595b181-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Jun-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Sam Barlow </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,General,VisualNovel</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>86.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  With a strong script, great use of FMV, and a simple yet empowering core game mechanic, Her Story is the most unique game Ive played in years. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Heritage of Kings_ The Settlers</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/95382e221574fb6e0f0126fc613d1b46-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Feb-05</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Blue Byte </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,CityBuilding,Management,Historic,Historic,Government</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>58.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>65.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The gameplay, which I had believed would be changing fairly significantly, hasn't really changed a bit.

Its got best-in-class animation, endearing heroes to cheer for, and villains you love to hate, all wrapped in good-natured humor. But on top of that everlasting charm, it turns a dynamic rock soundtrack into its greatest weapon, putting meticulous detail into syncing the beat to all aspects of the experience. It gives combat a uniquely satisfying momentum that other stylish-action games dont offer, even when the platforming and targeting system drop a couple notes along the way. Hi-Fi Rush is a memorable journey that marches to the beat of its own drum and without a doubt stands among the action greats. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Hidden &amp; Dangerous 2_ Sabre Squadron</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/0ba233fe5aa9767b29ab981436ea6a95-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>21-Oct-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Illusion Softworks </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Tactical,Historic,Historic</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>67.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Overall, the game needs some more technical polish and more extensive AI. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Hidden &amp; Dangerous 2</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/b3c4f26ebc5c1fe3ae9526e979adee6d-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>21-Oct-03</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Illusion Softworks </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Tactical,Historic,Historic</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>75.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>79.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  There are moments of brilliance in HD2, but also stretches of tedium and excessive saved game reloading, since you only have a few men and are usually working in stealth. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Hidden &amp; Dangerous</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/a0290c56efb19d0afb747bda295b891c-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>29-Jul-99</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Illusion Softworks </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,General,Shooter,First-Person,Tactical,Historic</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>74.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>76.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  A good game with a lot of flaws.

Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. Its certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldnt come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Hollow Knight</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/d4d3032660ea1a0552c985031b9798b5-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Feb-17</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Team Cherry </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,ActionAdventure,General,Platformer,,Metroidvania</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>87.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>94.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania with a well of content to discover thats as deep as its labyrinthine caves.

However, chasing consistent very high framerates above that (e.g. 120 FPS) seems like a fools errand even on top-end hardware. Ultimately the game is a visual spectacle and the gameplay is not particularly fast-paced, so the severe sacrifices in graphics necessary to achieve even relatively consistent 120 FPS do not appear to be worth it in this case. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Horizons_ Empire of Istaria</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/a10b77daf5ac8607453caf1df289dace-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>8-Dec-03</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Artifact Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,MassivelyMultiplayerOnline,MassivelyMultiplayer,Fantasy,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>72.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>82.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The ability to totally customize a character through multi-classing, the dichotomy of adventuring and crafting, the crafting system that will make most crafters extremely happy, plenty of low level content, good graphics and incredible music, along with a deep lore is worth a look if you think those things might be of interest to you. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Horizon</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/6f159382169f2f1a26dd230873c6545c-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>2-Jul-13</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>L3O Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):General,Strategy,Turn-Based,General,4X</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>58.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>65.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Some of the most disappointing games to play are those that have brilliant ideas, and even pull a few of them off, but cant maintain quality across the board.

Its simultaneously an easygoing puzzle game, a gorgeously gentle but affecting set of homespun stories, and an intricate, experimental exploration experience. The beauty of this is that it never feels the need to commit to one focus  I ended up pivoting between all three ideas organically; playing, toying and learning by turn as I sifted through Shelmerstons array of explorable still life objects. Neither Morris nor I Am Dead are perfect  but I sort of love them anyway.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>I Expect You To Die 2_ The Spy And The Liar</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/b8ba9bcfff79a2a723a87b5bc33437a6-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Aug-21</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Schell Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,3D,First-Person</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>83.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>0</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  I Expect You To Die 2 is a clever, surprising, and fun escape room-style puzzle game thats certainly worth exploring.

Attractive as the Chinese-themed reskin may be, just underneath is combat, exploration, and puzzle solving that is functionally nearly identical to what weve already played, and the characters arent nearly as much fun. After spending eight or so hours completing the story I have little compulsion to come back and check off all the things I didnt get to on the map  after all, that stuff wasnt particularly compelling in Immortals Fenyx Rising, and given that Myths of the Eastern Realm does precious little to change things up, its not particularly compelling here either.

Its madcap sense of humor is very hit or miss  for me, it's usually miss. But for the most part, that doesn't hurt its ability to tell a story with just enough intrigue to keep you guessing, while not overcomplicating things too much. The huge variety of distinct characters, hand-built tactical maps, and objectives assure that a long campaign never goes stale, with limited but meaningful merc progression that let me build my dream squad and play almost exactly how I wanted to, with the added tension of trying to keep them alive through each combat encounter.

Unfortunately, fiddly menus, a pretty terrible combat system, and at times clunky and unfriendly construction controls weigh down on the wonder of finding and creating. Despite all this, I still find myself drawn back into it to discover what more the designers have hidden in the world-generation code, as coming across a massive ruined castle or an active volcano for the first time is always a treat - and an inspiration for what I want to build next. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Leisure Suit Larry_ Box Office Bust</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/5d2aa89cc8418c8d283ae8ba939a43fe-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>31-Mar-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Team17 </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Adventure,Third-Person,Open-World,Modern,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>20.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>2.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>22.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The lowest rating numbers here at IGN are reserved for games with nearly no redeeming qualities or interesting ideas, with next to nothing enjoyable to offer players, and which under no circumstances should be purchased by anyone.

Instead, another story shoves it aside, trying to find the difference between what is right for someone and what is good for them, but there isnt enough time in this episode to deliver this message and round out everything else. This pace leaves it rushed and somewhat tunnel-visioned. That said, characters I cared about and real, hard choices which often dont feel truly right or wrong kept my gut firmly wrenched throughout. Light puzzles break up the talking and drama but again serve to remind us that correct isnt necessarily right. Instead, theres a strong single theme thats delivered well in a story that isnt afraid to get in a few punches. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Life is Strange_ Episode 1 - Chrysalis</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/ae56570ddab90394450b098380dfa886-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Jan-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>DONTNOD Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,General</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation3,PlayStation4,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>77.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>65.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Dontnod has created great scenarios for a story Im eager to learn more about, but the moment-to-moment interactions with people in Max Caulfields life are pretty painful. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Life is Strange_ Episode 2 - Out of Time</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/621535b24c7dd16299e8b444f1df7ba1-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Mar-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>DONTNOD Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,General</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation3,PlayStation4,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>77.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The ramifications of my actions in Life is Strange: Episode 2 - Out of Time have more than earned my interest in the rest of the season, even if it means enduring the inconsistent character performances and awkward writing. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Life is Strange_ Episode 3 - Chaos Theory</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/c8f2d3d9060e697a6a5e14e2c21842a4-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>19-May-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>DONTNOD Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,General</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation3,PlayStation4,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>80.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Chaos Theory doesnt bring many major moral choices to the table, but it doesnt matter  Maxs evolving time-travel power is growing into something bigger and scarier than she ever expected. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Life is Strange_ Episode 4 - Dark Room</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/c0a545b3ba93f16fcddd77e2ff9757fc-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>28-Jul-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>DONTNOD Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,General</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation3,PlayStation4,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>76.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>60.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Dark Room finally sets off the mystery but its the least consistent episode of Life Is Strange so far. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Life is Strange_ True Colors</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/ca4ca58dfcd74a470bf8c12add992b2d-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>10-Sep-21</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Deck Nine Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,General</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Stadia,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>81.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Deck Nine Games perfectly takes over from Dondnod, keeping the narrative formula intact and upgrading the licence technically.

The cool new atomic powers, amusing dialogue from the narrator, and excellent final boss are highlights, but are barely enough to make the rest of this return to Maneaters seas worth your while. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Maneater</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/d161c8055f157319fff52be4fc66f58a-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>22-May-20</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Tripwire Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,General,Open-World</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>70.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Its absolutely fun to play as mutant Jaws on steroids! Maneater chews the metaphorical scenery as often as it has you devouring humans and the diverse aquatic inhabitants of the Gulf of Mexico, and thats some good dumb entertainment  for a while. But if youre wondering whether its shallow combat and simplistic upgrades can sustain that excitement for the roughly 15 hours it takes to become a hulking megashark and reach the end of its uninspired satirical revenge story it cannot. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Manhunt</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/abf9e7e7223c116040ce335094921c15-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Apr-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Rockstar North </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Modern,General,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PlayStation4,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>75.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>83.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Now that the game is on Xbox and PC, Manhunt has lost a little bit of its shine, a little bit of its luster. Time certainly has something to do with that, the lackluster ending is a disappointment, and while there is much to admire about Manhunt's stealthy debut, the stealth itself isn't as deep as it could have been. It's still a high-quality game. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Maquette</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/95f6385a7b9f58710e5f13deea387245-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>2-Mar-21</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Graceful Decay </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,Puzzle,General,3D,First-Person</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>70.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Maquette is a clever and gorgeous puzzle game, even if it doesnt push the boundaries of its recursive concept very far past that initial sense of wonder. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Marc Ecko's Getting Up_ Contents Under Pressure</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/9e0f92d275b3821086a1985962502e59-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>14-Feb-06</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Double Helix Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Modern,General,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>69.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  I appreciate what this game is trying to do.

If it can continue to deliver the quality of dialogue and panel-perfect action over the course of the rest of the season, it may find itself seated in the upper echelons of Telltales catalog.

The slower drip of meaningful events meant I didnt come off of it with the same level of feel good euphoria I had after finishing Tangled Up in Blue, but Telltale is still doing an excellent job adapting this eccentric hero team to its tried-and-true format - particularly when the focus is on developing the characters and the relationships between them. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy - Episode 3_ More Than A Feeling</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/ba82cc0ce49f1fe428880046643a9304-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>22-Aug-17</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Telltale Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Adventure,General,3D,Third-Person</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>72.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>68.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  While its the weakest episode so far, More Than A Feeling still has some moments of payoff for leadership successes (and failures) earlier in the series. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy - Episode 4_ Who Needs You</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/98w-game.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>10-Oct-17</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Telltale Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Adventure,General,3D,Third-Person</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>71.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>86.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  I can definitely feel that end-of-series crunch happening in Who Needs You, where all the many choices Ive made have to converge back together to fit a limited number of endings. It comes across a bit heavy-handed in setting the stage for what seems like a somewhat predictable final chapter, but Telltale has surprised me before. As a standalone adventure, its definitely up there with Episode 1 as something Id play over a couple more times, not just to explore different choices but because its simply fun and exciting. The fact that it pulls very few emotional punches left me feeling a bit worn out, but also with a glowing sense of anticipation for the sprint to the finish and tying it all together. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy - Episode 5_ Don't Stop Believin'</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/a4e35c3c64bd8553ecd539a858cde4c3-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>7-Nov-17</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Telltale Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,General,Adventure,3D,Third-Person</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>68.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>72.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The core of Episode 5: Dont Stop Believin provides a thrilling and fulfilling resolution to the season arc with a couple interesting surprises in store.

Its missing some depth in its tools of destruction, has some bugs and wonkiness, and its thin story is a big ol nothing burger, but as a starting point for another live-service game from the team that brought us Dead By Daylight, it's extremely impressive. Running through dungeons to best whatever unknown deviousness your fellow player has left for you is a great time, limited only by what the community can concoct, and building your own bases is the ultimate reward for your hard work that never stops being hilarious. As someone who loves a good heist and relishes any opportunity to watch others fall before my evil genius, Meet Your Maker has been hard to put down. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Mega Man 11</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/10f0a8d2e531b46c14bf2fb016c070f5-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>2-Oct-18</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Platformer,2D</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>79.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>75.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Mega Man 11 is a good foundation for the next 10 Mega Man games. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Mega Man Legacy Collection</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/c4e2fca675c32dd439f12246754eef4f-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Aug-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Digital Eclipse </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Miscellaneous,Compilation</Genre><Platforms>3DS,PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Mega Man Legacy Collection is an object lesson for how game compilations should be engineered, providing rock-solid adaptation to a new platform, respecting the materials historic context, and exercising restraint. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Men of Valor</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/255bb00edf36e970c5cd771fb36e1d89-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>29-Oct-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>2015</GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Historic,Historic,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>71.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>68.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The "Medal of Honor" approach doesn't fit with such a controversial war, and the frankly simplistic combat becomes old pretty fast, a matter not helped by feeling hemmed in along a linear path, where one village tends to look like any other, as do the rivers, gulleys, and hilltops. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Men of War_ Vietnam</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/47b052e55396a4fe1a33eec2ca980206-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>8-Sep-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Best Way </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Military,General,Military,Tactics</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>68.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It's far from a perfect game -- inconsistent AI, a campaign that borders on the short side, and limited multiplayer options certainly hamper the experience -- but there's a lot of challenging satisfaction to be found beneath the thick jungle canopy. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Men of War</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/5cbc14ddef8454eb4b01da65d1aee076-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>16-Mar-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Best Way </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Historic,General,Historic,Tactics</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>80.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It's like watching all your favorite war movies play out in front of your eyes.

It's difficult to fully describe how amazing it feels to jump into a plane and have the freedom fly to and from literally any place in the entire world. The base game's 20 included aircraft feel like more than enough for even hardcore aviation enthusiasts, and the ability to adjust the assists to tailor the experience to whatever skill level you desire makes it suitable for anyone looking to fly the friendly skies from the comfort of their home. The real-world mapping data, however, takes Microsoft Flight Simulator from being just an impressive game to the most awe-inspiring simulation I've ever experienced, in spite of its less than stellar load times. Seeing famous landmarks, landing at the world's most recognizable airports, or just touching down in a remote landing strip in South America is mind-bogglingly cool and an absolutely unparalleled way to virtually explore our world. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Microsoft Flight</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/8659ba439413b2db517d7716465f15f3-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>29-Feb-12</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Microsoft Game Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Simulation,Flight,ModernJet,ModernJet,Combat</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>64.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>3.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>50.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Flight is best sampled in its freebie guise. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/2f12325c20f0007fbd38342f7ff04ef7-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Aug-00</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Microsoft Game Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Sports,Traditional,Individual,Golf,Sim,Sim</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>72.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>77.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  At a mere twenty bones, you're getting the bargain of the century. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Microsoft Train Simulator</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/eaad4bc323b70d9635989c2a29cf27ef-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>31-May-01</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Kuju Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Simulation,Train,Vehicle,Train</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>84.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The game is pretty cool but a little low on the excitement side, at least for my tastes...People who are nuts about trains -- you know who you are -- will find Train Sim to be the most in-depth and enjoyable train simulator on the market. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Middle-earth_ Shadow of Mordor</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/48539251d9a8df2ca9906587a3ff1fb4-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Sep-14</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Monolith Productions </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Fantasy,ActionAdventure,Fantasy,Open-World</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,PlayStation4,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>84.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>93.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor stands out from other open-world action games by putting a great new layer on top of the trail that Batman blazed.

It plays it extremely safe, though, without bringing anything mining or crafting spins to the genre to accompany Minecrafts signature look and feel. Still, it's just so damn charming, and so fun, it's hard to fault it for going the safe route. With tons of loot, secret areas to uncover, and progressively more aggressive difficulty levels to unlock, Minecraft Dungeons has a fair amount of replayability beyond its relatively short six to eight-hour story mode. But who plays Minecraft for the story, anyway? </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Minecraft_ Story Mode - Episode 1_ The Order of the Stone</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/853114e93052870d93073030f5a8a915-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>13-Oct-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Telltale Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Adventure,General,Point-and-Click,Linear</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,iPhone/iPad,PlayStation3,PlayStation4,WiiU,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>71.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>73.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The drama might not be as heightened as something like The Walking Dead, but I still found myself surprisingly invested in the choices I had to make about my companions, undeveloped as they may be, and smiling at the Minecrafty in-jokes. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Minecraft</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/0ec49754f864a372073dcc684094385d-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>18-Nov-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Mojang AB </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Adventure,3D,Sandbox,First-Person,Fantasy,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>3DS,PlayStation3,PlayStation4,PlayStationVita,Switch,WiiU,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>93.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Minecraft, more than any other game I know, isn't about playing it a specific way; it's an open-world, a blank page just daring you to jump in and do with it what you will.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Miner Wars 2081</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/b5d4e8ec39d859840dfcba37e68713a9-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>28-Nov-12</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Keen Software House </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Simulation,Shooter,Sci-Fi,Space,Third-Person,SmallSpaceship,Combat,Sci-Fi</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>52.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>50.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Somewhere inside Miner Wars 2081 is an incredibly ambitious, frighteningly absorbing space game.

France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Yes, Sunbreak is indeed the Iceborn of Monster Hunter Rise. Capcom strikes again a great blow with this DLC as substantial as qualitative. Once again, it is practically a new game that is presented here and players who will embark on the full adventure with this DLC will have a lot to do. If we understand that Rise has seen its development greatly slowed down by the health situation, since well caught up by the content offered in the meantime, Sunbreak does not suffer from this shortcoming. The game is rich in content, in a relatively varied proposal and in a challenge, admittedly slow for the most annoyed of us, but which will eventually show its face towards the End-Game. Moreover, Sunbreak has a care brought in its form as probably never before, the cinematics are beautiful, the new armors are almost all hit, the characters are all endearing and what to say about this epic OST! We'll criticize the appearance of the new bestiary, drowned in the overdose of the previous monsters. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Monster Hunter Rise_ Sunbreak</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/537c12db520d462b2a689c707f4d909c-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Jun-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionRPG</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>86.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>3.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is an enjoyable expansion full of cool new monsters but not many new ideas. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Monster Hunter Stories 2_ Wings of Ruin</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/decc2ecdb6d9990d6899bea5f9696a79-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>9-Jul-21</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Japanese-Style</Genre><Platforms>Switch,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>82.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a beautifully presented JRPG with a plethora of fun things to do and deep systems I happily got lost in  but a few issues leave it short of being flawless. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Monster Hunter_ World - Iceborne</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/ea4380a9dcf9d5d6b2c185c575bf0adc-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>9-Jan-20</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionRPG</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>87.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Monster Hunter World: Iceborne adds loads of impressive monsters and tons of quality-of-life improvements to an already incredible game...The only major mark against it is that the PC version of Iceborne is still lagging behind its console counterparts in terms of updates and post-launch content, much of which builds on the already top-notch host of monsters and quality-of-life adjustments Iceborne brought at release.

Although it can be an aggravating slog to get through its escort quest-heavy levels, its also a unique, delightfully bizarre, and utterly rewarding experience with a fantastic story and a lot of heart. Of course, it also has far too many bugs that force restarts to circumvent, and that can turn the frustration of a good challenge into the bad, controller-throwing kind, and the sound design is all over the place. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Odyssey_ The Search for

But as a bite-sized 2D action adventure, it leaves a very strong impression thanks to a magical harpoon that makes fighting, moving, and discovering secrets especially rewarding. Its combat in particular packs a surprising amount of depth and flexibility, even if its enemies and bosses never really stepped up and demanded that I engage with that depth to defeat them. Much like Faraday himself, I dont see myself ever returning to Olijas mysterious world, but its an adventure I wont soon forget.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>OlliOlli World</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/99474595ccc19395047d9ae4e833d25b-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>8-Feb-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>roll7 </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Platformer,2D</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>87.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Rollercoaster-like courses and a wealth of moves make OlliOlli World a huge amount of fun to play, whether youre just cruising or out to become a true skate god. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Omerta_ City of Gangsters</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/fc1f0c8f9ce0a52f45d7768dff05e45c-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>31-Jan-13</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Kalypso, Haemimont Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Simulation,General,Strategy,Turn-Based,General,General,Tactics</Genre><Platforms>Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>54.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>52.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It suffers from an almost total absence of risk or failure even on the hardest difficulty.

A lot of my enjoyment comes from revisiting an old favorite, but there's not enough new stuff here to recommend this to someone new to the series. The save system, terrible animations, and unskippable cutscenes just don't work in the modern era. It's a shame, because Onimusha is one of my favorite PS2 games, and just a few tweaks to some of the older systems would have helped enormously. The modern release is exactly how I remember it, and unfortunately in 2019, that's just not good enough. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Oni</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/46ea0610dce1b075e606b425593a1af8-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>28-Jan-01</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Bungie </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Beat-'Em-Up,Beat-'Em-Up,3D</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>73.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>75.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It certainly does do the major things that it promised to when it comes to creating a fast paced fighter, but doesn't really reach the godly state that everyone really hoped that it would. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Operation Blockade</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/8f90fe7a56895cbc8b2e9ed2fecf1f96-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>13-May-02</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Screaming Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,Rail,Rail</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>49.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>40.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  I would prefer the soothing comfort of a spork being gouged in my eye rather than playing a few more minutes of this game. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Operation Flashpoint_ Cold War Crisis</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/640751015bdd6ad3df226553c80baee7-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Aug-01</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Bohemia Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Tactical,Modern,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>88.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  There is so much going into this game its just plain goofy.

The story is still pretty lackluster, most boss fights are irritating slogs, and even with the added endgame grind there isnt a ton of content to chew on, but most of whats been added is at least ton of fun. The improved options with Pax Points, Ascension Points, and Apocalypse items are a stat-obsessed players dream and had me tweaking my build for maximum devastation, and the Trial of Tarya Gratar endgame dungeon is challenging and memorable if also a bit repetitive. Still, getting another chance to run amok on Enoch was time well spent. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Outward</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/713f391141942f0e9b10aeaaab4f1015-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>26-Mar-19</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Nine Dots Studio </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionAdventure,General,Survival,Open-World</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Stadia,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>67.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>50.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Outward is an open-world survival RPG that starved me of fun and left me thirsty for bug fixes and a better combat system. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Overclocked_ A History of Violence</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/ea35fdd0ee3a9d40c6ee636ab02c2d46-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>7-Apr-08</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>House of Tales </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,General,General,3D,Third-Person</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>70.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The haunting main theme (especially if it's dark and you're overtired) and gloom of rainy New York adds an appropriate layer of anxiety to the experience, which is short enough to play in a single weekend day sitting if you're really on the edge of your seat. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>OVERKILL's The Walking Dead</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/5fd36e7f3289710786db032419d52479-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>6-Nov-18</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Starbreeze </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Sci-Fi,Action,Shooter,First-Person,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>51.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>53.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Co-op zombie-splattering will never be devoid of fun, but Overkill's The Walking Dead is lacking in both the series' storytelling and technical polish. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Overland</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/5041ac74eb0e27f43556ea1997f5edc5-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>19-Sep-19</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Finji </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Adventure,Turn-Based,General,Tactics</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>69.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>75.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Overlands increasingly weird apocalypse and clever approach to tactical survival makes it an interesting take on the roguelike road trip genre.

After a whole game of learning the story, youre suddenly the one writing the ending. The most important person a detective needs to prove a case to is themselves, to give them the confidence to pass those details along. Paradise Killer treats you in much the same way. By the end of its 15 hours, the only person you really need to convince is yourself: Is that the ending you want to see? OK, prove it. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Paradise Lost</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/de45fdcad8d80c864021709f481da41f-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Mar-21</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>PolyAmorous </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,3D,First-Person</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>58.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>50.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Paradise Lost fails to take full advantage of its gripping premise and the haunting atmosphere of its setting, falling short of the standard set by other first-person narrative experiences released in recent years. Its not as detail-rich as Gone Home, the radio-based relationship between its two leads never reaches the same level of intimacy as Firewatch, and its storytelling isnt nearly as inventive or interactive as that of What Remains of Edith Finch. I admire the imagination thats gone into realising the architecture of its underground facility, but I just wish the scarcity of story detail and character development within it hadnt left me feeling colder than a concrete corridor. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>ParaWorld</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/9075e94e760de213a6b7915a224054c3-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>27-Sep-06</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>SEK Ost </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Fantasy,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>71.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>78.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  A well presented game with a terrific opening cutscene to get players ready to go and a story that could have been terrific were it not for some holes and inconsistencies.

There's a great sense of wonder to be had by impossifying rides, and the simple interface makes it easy to do. Incrementally unlocking new rides and increasing park capacity is rewarding, and creating something utterly ludicrous can be a blast. But that joy dissipates quickly when parks become unmanageable, as the attendees get stuck, staff ignores pressing needs, and financial ruin springs seemingly out of nowhere, while bugs and crashes make a late-campaign difficulty spike a miserable slog. Like riding an unfinished roller coaster, theres fun to be had until the eventual crash, but it feels like this park just isnt ready to be opened.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Past Cure</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/21a4924c8f5345c1b451505730a7a631-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>2-Feb-18</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Phantom 8 </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,ActionAdventure,General,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>48.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>58.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Past Cure never does anything special. Every time it tries to do something interesting, it immediately forgets about it and does something else. Dont get me wrong: its not a bad thing to include a number of genres within one game. In fact, it can help keep it fresh if they serve as a breather from a strong central idea. The problem is that Past Cure has no strong central idea to take a break from or return to. Whether its the initially compelling yet convoluted supernatural story or the interesting gimmicks that never leave the tech demo phase, its a disorganized bundle of ideas that are never given a chance to develop into something out of the ordinary. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Path of Exile</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/2226db47f6e1fc3116091cb1a07ceaac-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>25-Jan-13</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Grinding Gear Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionRPG,Role-Playing,ActionRPG</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>86.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>88.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Path of Exile successfully captures the spirit of older action RPGs and updates it for an experience that's as visually appealing as it's fun. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Pathfinder_ Kingmaker</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/e9f9c7d4a8dfbdf4d710659ced2c34ca-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>25-Sep-18</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Owlcat Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionRPG,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>73.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>68.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Pathfinder: Kingmaker delivers a fantastic story and a deep character system to dive into.

My gripes about it are all relatively minor, and I look forward to playing it at least once or twice more to explore roads not taken. It never suffers for its simplicity, lacking in combat or traditional puzzles, because of how effectively it tangled me up in the complexities of its gorgeously-realized world and made me want to learn all I could about its people and its past. There isn't much more to say about Pentiment, other than I can hardly recommend it highly enough. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Penumbra_ Black Plague</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/8be0d5febbe66dd772d05f48b78b94eb-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>12-Feb-08</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Frictional Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Horror,Horror,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>78.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>77.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Without the awkward combat of Overture, Black Plague is a smoother experience where the clumsiness of the physics and control systems are exposed far less frequently. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Penumbra_ Overture</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/3a83b2dc1f88b6ce398c79132fb5ebd6-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Mar-07</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Frictional Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Horror,Horror,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>73.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Let's just hope they fix the combat and add a bit more character development in the next episode. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Penumbra_ Requiem</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/1c84ea316d4c198f5be157684081d1f4-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>27-Aug-08</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Frictional Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Horror,Horror,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>67.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>75.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  While its puzzle and gameplay structure remains entertaining and satisfying, the expansion removes a few major elements of what made the Overture and Black Plague so appealing.

Steam features such as achievements and cloud saves are included, and even the minor online aspects of the Golden version were faithfully ported. Additionally, this release adds the ability to choose between English and Japanese voice acting, a very welcome addition in what is inherently a very Japanese game. The nit-picks such as video asset quality, locked aspect ratio, and even the far-worse-than-it-could-be performance are all at least somewhat understandable from a development and prioritization perspective, and do little to detract from the quality of the port in most practical cases. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Peter Jackson's King Kong_ The Official Game of the Movie</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/34082f76a87c50ef9e37e65c9a44b2b8-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>21-Nov-05</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Ubisoft Montpellier </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Modern,General,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>77.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  A short but memorable game packed with high-level artistic aesthetics and production values.

It smartly updates the gameplay with optional assists that make it a snap to jump in and get right to the most satisfying parts of the action. This open area of space were free to defend or exploit is full of side activities (including a crazy ship-painting tool), and those blunt the inherent repetition of fighter-vs-fighter combat scenarios. And the story  while definitely padded out more than it needs to be  is suitably small-scale and personal for a mercenary/smuggler type like Juno Markev. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Rebel Galaxy</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/ea3d99a9ad60adc3279f81f2b1d3f09b-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Oct-15</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Double Damage Games, Inc., Double Damage Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,ActionAdventure,General,Open-World</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>75.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  While it's not as deep as it first appears, fun and fast naval-style combat and a vast explorable galaxy made me want to try out each of its different styles of captaining, and kept me happily blasting away. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Rebels_ Prison Escape</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/4debc31f12e171544685af7ecdbca5b3-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>26-Aug-03</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Philoslabs </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Modern,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>47.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>0</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>55.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  In the long run, Rebels can't seem to decide whether it wants to be an adventure game or a stealth sim of some kind, and this ambiguity prevents it from melding the two ideas together. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Recettear_ An Item Shop's Tale</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/deb2829ba6a2246f09326739bb25497f-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>10-Sep-10</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>EasyGameStation </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Simulation,Miscellaneous,VirtualLife,Virtual,VirtualLife</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>82.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>75.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Have you ever wanted to man the item counter in a role-playing game like Torneko from Dragon Quest IV?

This is a triumphant sequel that doesnt just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way  including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, its very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year.

The thrill of finally beating a boss thats had your number for hours is right up there with the Souls games that so clearly inspired it, though the underwhelming gear system sometimes brings down the high of overcoming the frequent difficulty spikes. Overall, its a solid game that offers one of the best and most rewarding co-op experiences in quite some time, as long as you have a hint of desire to challenge and punish yourself over and over. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Remote Assault</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/2204c3236fe43cac2b930d6cc12d1d48-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>29-Jul-01</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Shrapnel Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>62.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>0</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>53.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Winds up seeming flat and uninspired.

While Ashmann Inn is rich with suitably menacing horror movie-inspired interiors to explore, the actual encounters with its inhabitants are frustratingly clumsy and Jennifers moth ability is a poor substitute for the more cerebral puzzle-solving of 2018's Tormented Fathers.

With more mission variety, character development, and technical polish I could see this being an unexpectedly fun top-down shooter. As it is, its lack of ambition in scenario design makes too little use of its unique mechanic which, in itself, doesnt always work the way youd expect it to. Bloody Days also fails to really capture the feel of the movie on which its based, presenting iconic characters as cheap knock offs that spout their signature lines at odd moments like pull-string toys. While the shooting can be fun and challenging, this ones definitely not worth losing an ear over. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Reservoir Dogs</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/fe7817c40100d5ae77e40ddf8dd490a5-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Oct-06</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Volatile Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Modern,General,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>50.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>30.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Repetitive gameplay and limited replayability and difficulty settings are just the tip of the iceberg of a game that could've explored so much more of the characters from the movie, but just barely scratched the surface of the film. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Resident Evil 0_ HD Remaster</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/57126e4e6f6a2513f72971cc04a6fedc-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>19-Jan-16</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,PlayStation4,Switch,Xbox360,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>68.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>65.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Its a forgettable entry in an outstanding series that just doesnt measure up because of its story problems, overwhelming inventory management, and horrible predictability. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Resident Evil 2</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/52e5269998add3b4376c3281bc0dd590-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>25-Jan-19</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom R&amp;D Division 1 </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>89.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Now THIS is how you remake a classic.

Although its just-okay multiplayer mode falls short of the bar set by its magnificent single-player campaign, the latter does such a good job at balancing 2020 gameplay and a classic Resident Evil tone that I recommend it without reservations.

 Risk of Rain 2s early access hooked me with its fluid 3D action and distinct classes, and held my attention long after Id seen everything it had to offer with its berserk roguelike progression, and the ability to squad up with friends. Its networking woes could use some TLC, but thats the only bad news. Whats here now is polished, fun, and immensely replayable, and whats on the horizon leads me to believe Ill be playing Risk of Rain 2 for a very long time to come.

Containing none of the breadth of new units and new strategies that the Total War expansions have been known for, Alexander feels more like a mission pack.

This one is definitely better the second time around.

Because of that, its fair to say that its world, graphical style, and mechanics arent wholly original, but there are enough interesting twists in its 30-hour story to make for a rich and enjoyable experience of its own merit. This isnt just nostalgia fodder. That said, its twitchy combat can be difficult to get a handle on, and once you do, it only stays interesting for so long before its limited customization options make it start to feel just a little repetitive. Thats made up for by a strong soundtrack, an approachable and endearing story, and a wide number of fun zones and boss fights that make this a trip worth taking. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Sea of Thieves</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/e7c904af1ce29b50be1ad577e85aea01-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Mar-18</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Rare Ltd. </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,ActionAdventure,MassivelyMultiplayer,Open-World</Genre><Platforms>XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>67.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Whats here is an amazing foundation for a social experience thats beautifully realized , and that makes it frustrating that its gameplay loop is so repetitive and its progression is so stagnant. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Second Sight</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/388f03701e8117473c07c9927715d1eb-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>18-Feb-05</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Free Radical Design </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,General</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>73.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>75.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Has a surprisingly good story and voice acting, but it suffers from a combat system that's both flawed and too easy, and from underwhelming visuals that wouldn't be so bad if the stealth action genre wasn't so competitive. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Secret Files_ Tunguska</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/67aa3863636382f194b0be23dc554222-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Oct-06</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Fusionsphere Systems </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,General,General,Point-and-Click</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,Switch,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>66.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>76.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It won't blow you away with its narrative or characters, but Secret Files: Tunguska can still entertain with some interesting puzzles and easy to use interface. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Secret Weapons Over Normandy</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/120da6c988dc9158a4f529abc504d4c0-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>18-Nov-03</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Totally Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Simulation,Flight,WWII,WWII,Combat</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>72.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  I can appreciate it as a fun action game but it holds little of the weight you'd expect from a World War II dogfight game.

But thanks to its strong visual storytelling techniques and the way the opening minutes inspire an irresistible desire to find out what happened to this man and whether or not hell ever find his family, Somerville is nevertheless a very good tour through an exceptionally bleak scenario  all of which is successfully conveyed without a single line of dialogue. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Sonic Generations</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/10643a5ed9cb60339efbb15514c80054-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>3-Nov-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Sega, Sonic Team </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Platformer,Platformer,3D,3D</Genre><Platforms>3DS,PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>77.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It feels refreshing to be able to say that Sonic is good again.

Rehydrateds revisit of the iconic SpongeBob platformer often does just that. Rather than addressing any of the real issues with Battle for Bikini Bottom that could have been tweaked without ruining the spirit of the original, it leaves history intact at the cost of making this a better game  and its problems have only become more noticeable with age and increased competition. There are bright spots that remain fun almost two decades later, and there are pops of ingenuity in its reworking, but it does little to stand alongside the best, or even the pretty good, platformer remakes and remasters weve seen this generation. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Spore Galactic Adventures</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/0b3d049592bc2eacaf98dd32295660be-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>27-Aug-08</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Electronic Arts </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Breeding/Constructing,General,Breeding/Constructing</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>70.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>77.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The Civilization stage still feels relatively cut-and-dry, and the Tribal stage resembles a rudimentary real-time strategy game.

What really stinks is that the actual gameplay isn't exciting enough to support the setting. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Star Wars_ Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/64c1da74887ddae03974864ff0344c28-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>8-Feb-05</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Obsidian Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Third-Person,Third-Person,General,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,Switch,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>87.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  More importantly, all these mechanics -- the moral slider, the influence system, combat, etc. -- are surrounded by a first rate story that's almost as mythic and fantastic as the films themselves. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Star Wars_ Knights of the Old Republic</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/fa5c67e8ea63a4c14cdacc9555accc60-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>18-Nov-03</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>BioWare </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Third-Person,Third-Person,General,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,Switch,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>93.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It's got enough Star Wars to satisfy the fans and enough pure fun to draw in people who normally wouldn't get into role-playing games. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Star Wars_ Republic Commando</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/deac477cda21a22bdafc49658ac5686a-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>1-Mar-05</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>LucasArts </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Switch,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>78.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>82.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Presentation is really what carries Republic Commando farther than it could have gone on its own.

Its engaging space combat is a great balance of approachable arcade control with the added nuance of simulation-like systems, which combine with astonishingly detailed ships and cockpits for the most authentic-feeling ride since LucasArts legendary X-Wing and TIE Fighter games back in the 90s. Star Wars: Squadrons doesnt end up doing anything too memorable with its charming characters or interesting rival squadron setup, but this campaign still tells an entertaining Star Wars story I enjoyed no matter which cockpit I was in.

Not to get ahead of things, but playing this excellent World War II game makes it hard not to get excited about the potential of Steel Division: Stalingrad '42 or Rome '43. Future games or expansions might even smooth out Normandy 44s small drawbacks, specifically its occasionally overwhelming amount of detail and lack of context to its huge number of options, but its successes wildly outweigh its failures. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Steel Soldiers</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/6ff27c8e1c68bf9d3b846bcfb6b7dd3b-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>15-Jun-01</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>The Bitmap Brothers </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,General,Command</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>70.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>78.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Some of the ideas in this game are really good, it's just too bad that the execution of said ideas wasn't a little better and a little more time had been put into creating factions with differences (both sides use the same units).  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Steep</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/aae7d0abb6236fbfda60b7f45a0158f3-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>2-Dec-16</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Ubisoft Annecy </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Sports,Individual,Ski/Snowboard</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>72.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>79.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The core snowboarding and skiing events are enjoyable enough to easily forgive mediocre elements, like the slow and sleepy paragliding mode, that feel like needless gimmicks.

You can tell when playing it that its been a labor of love from a team that appreciates musical theater, complete with unique artistic choices, crafted songs that shift based on your choices, and characters loaded with emotional angst. The gods are grappling with how they fit into the modern world and with lifes traumas, just as many of us (and I imagine the writers) are. But the overall predictability of the story and of these well-known Greek myths limit how replayable Stray Gods ultimately feels.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Street Fighter IV</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/320de58b94d10aaf7cd7999d2016b2a2-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>1-Jul-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Fighting,Fighting,3D,2D,3D</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>91.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>89.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Street Fighter IV is a great game overall and Capcom should be commended for designing a game that can work on so many levels by appealing to both casual and hardcore players. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Street Fighter V</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/df91067c4776d9bc03151f73eb8482f2-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>16-Feb-16</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Fighting,2D</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>74.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>3.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Its hard to criticize something that seems like it was tailor-made for a wannabe competitive player like me, but I just cant ignore how little Street Fighter 5 does for the average fighting game player. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Street Fighter X Mega Man</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/43d1a9845793d02391ada72bf5c4ad66-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>17-Dec-12</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Platformer,Platformer,2D,2D</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>71.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  A fine game that Mega Man fans will enjoy once or twice, but one without that special something that would allow it to rise to the greatness Mega Man so regularly reached in its heyday. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Streets of Rage 4</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/a37807579dbc6e3f4d3b759a57ca4577-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Apr-20</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Lizardcube </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Beat-'Em-Up,2D</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation4,Stadia,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>84.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Streets of Rage 4 delivers the greatest hits of the classic series and is at its best when played with at least one friend.

Efforts to bring gameplay variety to each playable character havent really shaken things up to any notable degree, and the quicktime event-based survival sequences adhere to a stress-inducing formula thats starting to feel a bit too familiar. Ominous animatronics and a hulking aggressor mean the concluding chapter of The Dark Pictures Anthology is still capable of inducing the occasional jump scare, but for the most part The Devil in Mes tour through a maniacs mansion is disappointingly lacking in any real menace or surprise. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Darkness II</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/d2da92b089bc942e1c0d87f71b4d6af6-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>6-Feb-12</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Digital Extremes </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,Shooter,First-Person,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>77.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It may not end up being the best shooter of 2012, but it could very well be the one that makes you feel the most powerful. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Devil Inside</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/f148b77ebfec9a22f382551dfb1eef8f-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>9-Nov-00</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Cryo Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,General,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>76.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>81.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  In today's modern age of deeper survival horror, Devil Inside ultimately leaves you wishing that those demons from hell would have brought along a little more to chew on than switches and bullets.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Disney Afternoon Collection</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/12115d0ea986f33add8112c9139a0a47-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>18-Apr-17</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Capcom, Digital Eclipse </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Miscellaneous,Compilation</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>78.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  With three hits and three duds from Capcom/Disney years that you might remember with varying levels of fondness, the Disney Afternoon Collection is clearly aimed at children of the 90s.

 The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood delivers more of the same  albeit this new helping is a step up from last years Greymoor expansion in its often funny writing and striking map layout. Blackwood leans hard on its nostalgia, but it actually manages to feel like an appropriate prequel to Oblivion without forcing you down too many of the same paths. Its companion system is definitely worth checking out, too, but it may not be enough gameplay variety to recommit a fan who is tired of ESO in general.

The episodes look great, and Cara Gees performance as the main character is excellent, helping to recreate the feel of the television series even when the most of the regular characters from the show are absent. The game struggles to find engaging mechanics outside of its dialogue scenes, relying too heavily on quicktime events and mediocre movement challenges. But the story and choices you make work well enough that these are minor faults.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Experiment (2007)</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/2434c93ef5760f908a6ffe5970c26ccc-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>5-Feb-08</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Lexis Numerique </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,General,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>68.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>68.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The details of the story surrounding the Tyriade creatures and the researchers studying them are compelling enough to keep you going, especially if they eventually patch the crash bug, so if you're look for an adventure with a very different vibe, you can Experiment with this one. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The First Templar</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/e64a958ffe1eea1b3a8c6080239f0d80-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>12-May-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Haemimont, Haemimont Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Adventure,General,Historic,General,Historic</Genre><Platforms>Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>57.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>40.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The First Templar is not good.

Many of its flaws are of the type that seem like they might be remedied via post-release patching, but in its existing state The Last Case of Benedict Fox is like one of its protagonists bungled double jumps  it reaches for greatness but falls a bit too short of the mark.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Last Federation</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/690fac433da10e7132cf298b1f9beb55-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>18-Apr-14</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Arcen Games, LLC </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Turn-Based,Sci-Fi,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>72.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>69.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  A noble attempt at creating a new kind of science-fiction strategy game thats sadly weaker than the sum of its parts. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Last Hero of Nostalgaia</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/8a552f41a808253aa3890cc94f8aa3e6-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>19-Oct-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Over The Moon </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,General</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>75.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The Last Hero of Nostalgaia is a competent RPG with a world that helps it stand out from the pack, even if it doesn't stand too far above it. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Last Remnant</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/7db1fe98f00d9146cda1c9b7f83d52f3-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>24-Mar-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Square Enix </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Console-styleRPG,Console-styleRPG,Japanese-Style</Genre><Platforms>Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>66.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>68.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The Last Remnant isn't for those who crave story and strong characterization in their single-player role-playing games.

Still, its two hours of puzzles were certainly worth solving. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Saga of Ryzom</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/22855e7d3f3863c7f4a073917d07c4a6-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Sep-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Nevrax </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,MassivelyMultiplayerOnline,MassivelyMultiplayer,Fantasy,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>64.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>75.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Has the potential to turn into a real contender, but not until they smooth out player introduction, get some more players on board (a Catch .22, granted), take care of network lag, and introduce quests to make gameplay more rewarding and better paced overall. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Secret of Monkey Island_ Special Edition</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/87b62687b62b06955ec28637e0d2c261-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>15-Jul-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>LucasArts </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,General,General,Point-and-Click</Genre><Platforms>iPhone/iPad,PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>86.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>87.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Playing this adventure will take you back to a simpler, more innocent time before games needed to bash us over the head with ultra violence to get our attention.

 The Stanley Parables base game truly holds up almost a decade later, both in its hilarious narrated writing and the clever satire that houses it. Ultra Deluxe may seem like little more than a decent lighting improvement and a simple console port on the surface, but the new content thats been added alongside those things is on the scale of a whole new game. Those new encounters are consistently impressive and always entertaining, even if the feeling that weve seen some of these tricks before means they never quite reached the heights of my first surprising playthrough back in 2013. But if youve never played The Stanley Parable at all, Ultra Deluxe is a definitive version that provides another extremely convincing reason to do so. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Stanley Parable</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/f817874769625568a41f65245a381fbf-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>17-Oct-13</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Davey Wreden </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Adventure,General,General,3D,First-Person,Modern</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>88.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>88.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  All its different plotlines and personalities overlap and combine to create something thats intriguingly opaque, but always entertaining, and genuinely funny.

For now, however, my recommendation comes with a lot of caveats. While the less lopsided take on the asymmetrical horror format definitely works, the shallow number of samey maps can get monotonous pretty quickly, and even with a fair number of playable characters and a solid progression system, I found myself way too comfortable with the three scenarios after just a few hours. Still, the potential behind this format and the reverence for the beloved horror classic its based on is clear, even when it does feel a tad half-baked coming out the gates. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Thing</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/3dacec18a2a41d5b048273ef94576452-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Aug-02</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Computer Artworks </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):ActionAdventure,Horror,Horror,Survival</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation2,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>77.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The visuals and sound are top notch and the sense of desperation you feel when you are stuck outside and about to succumb to the elements or being hunted by packs of the foul creatures is very real. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Turing Test</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/edd24c3f0eb3c1723021cc1d4926f913-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Aug-16</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Bulkhead Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,First-Person,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Stadia,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>74.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Its mechanics are solid but largely unoriginal, and its themes and world-building are genuinely great.

Theres a sturdy story to drive it forward, though it too is let down at the last moment by an ill-considered final battle that renders all your decision-making throughout the campaign worthless. And while The Valiant does have multiplayer, dont count on being able to find any opponents to clash with online. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/1b5a0e062acf03bc85b6edea269ea893-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>25-Sep-14</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>The Astronauts </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Miscellaneous,Adventure,General,3D,First-Person</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>82.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  An amazing achievement.

Its great to see performances from Norman Reedus and the rest from this perspective, but its use of the popular TV show characters and environments is lacking because it never goes anywhere or shows us anything we havent already seen.

You'll get an experience much more like a Civil War-era wargame with Fall of the Samurai, as opposed to a medieval wargame with the original Shogun 2, and that, in itself, is worth the cost of admission, let alone all the new units, locations, abilities, factions, and bells/whistles. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Total War_ Shogun 2</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/ff7021fc576aea5718c9bd1c1cc9796d-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>15-Mar-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Creative Assembly </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Turn-Based,Historic,General,Historic</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>90.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Shogun 2 is an expertly tuned turn-based strategy game filled with exhilarating real-time tactical battles against a capable artificial intelligence or others online.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Total War_ Three Kingdoms</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/c16ec914a0e34c6eb78f1b58e4640f67-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>23-May-19</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Creative Assembly </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.6</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>93.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Total War: Three Kingdoms uses excellent pacing and strong character mechanics to create a consistently exciting and challenging historical strategy campaign.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Total War_ WARHAMMER III</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/c5cb90288fe527b5f3f0600809a0911c-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>17-Feb-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Creative Assembly </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Tactics</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  An incredible abundance of mechanisms and factions to play and replay with in this new installment of the saga.

The Chaos Realms cleverly draw these larger-than-life figures together, so even those from remote corners of the world will be able to test each other's mettle. And while the size of the faction list currently feels a bit disappointing coming from Mortal Empires, all of the newly introduced factions are inventive and just plain fun on the campaign and battle maps. The true test of Warhammer 3 is still to come, when we'll get to play with all the factions from all three games on the massive combined map. But even if that's the main reason you're interested in it, there's plenty of excitement to be had already. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Total War_ WARHAMMER

The transition to modern tech has introduced some camera problems, though, and I wish Square Enix had taken this opportunity to flesh out the world with interesting sidequests and to trim out some of the more tedious dialogue.

Growing my college, hiring and training faculty, adding new courses, spiffing up my dorms, and watching my grades and profits soar in the Sandbox mode is addicting enough that I could keep at it for dozens of hours more, even after having put in almost 40 hours for this review. The art style and quirky humor don't really do it for me most of the time, but they're usually not actively obnoxious, and eventually I sort of just tuned them out. At the end of the semester, I'd pass Two Point Campus with a solid B+. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Two Point Hospital</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/100188bda99ec2834452afc1fc391f75-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>29-Aug-18</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Two Point Studios </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Simulation,Strategy,Management,Virtual,Career,Business/Tycoon</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,Switch,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E10+</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>83.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>84.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Two Point Hospital revitalizes the business management genre with flair, character, and enthusiasm. Easily understandable tips and icons make it relatively stress-free to get a working urgent care center running smoothly, while the potential for deep optimization through tweaking building layout and making wise hiring and training decisions leave plenty to munch on for the micromanagement lovers among us. If were on the verge of another classic genre renaissance, this is a great first foot forward. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Two Worlds II</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/f35503f43c3c19dd3610b7a2af0e2d86-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>3-Feb-11</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Reality Pump </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Third-Person,Third-Person,General,ActionRPG</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>75.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.4</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>60.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  While the timer on my save read around 14 hours by the time I screamed and shouted and pushed my way through Two Worlds II's final (miserable, cheap, and poorly designed) boss encounter, I would put my play time in the neighborhood of 35 hours, at least.

Its not scary enough to succeed as a horror story, its controls are too clumsy to provide a satisfying stealth experience, and its enemy and puzzle variety are too limited to make any part of the journey feel truly distinct. What begins as an intriguing incursion into a cult-ruled realm soon unravels into a repetitive slog stuck in the shoes of an unlikeable lead character.

It may not be the prettiest modern FPS around, but its visual simplicity enables excellent clarity in every fight.

The bewitching spell of its appeal can be broken by the duller stretches between when you find a great build or unlock a challenging new mode, but it probably wont be long until you find a new way to challenge yourself to survive just a few seconds longer.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Vampire_ The Masquerade - Bloodlines</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/35d91c1d6ffb7e7411cbe5f2dd0fe41f-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>16-Nov-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Troika Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,First-Person,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>80.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>84.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Unfortunately, the AI has the intelligence of a doorknob sometimes, which keeps the shine off an otherwise delightful and multilayered experience. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Vampire_ The Masquerade - Redemption</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/700db7b25d9886943067bf691815d79c-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>7-Jun-00</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Nihilistic </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,PC-styleRPG,PC-styleRPG,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>74.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.2</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  A grand mess, a game that for all its beauty and energy is plagued by problems which keep it from being a truly great game.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Vampire_ The Masquerade - Swansong</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/39d936c8f2b19793be653e4b714b6eb0-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>19-May-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Big Bad Wolf </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>66.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>3.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>60.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  They are far too many structural and functional issues with Swansong, but if you like this vampiric license, the story will give you the strength to face them all. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Vampire_ The Masquerade - Swansong</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/39d936c8f2b19793be653e4b714b6eb0-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>19-May-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Big Bad Wolf </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,Western-Style</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>66.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>3.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>50.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Vampire: The Masquerade  Swansong falls short of its ambitions as a story-focused detective RPG due to a dense but uninteresting plot, bland characters, and unintuitive puzzles. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Vanguard_ Saga of Heroes</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/78171207b10ac2221cb72e202aa32a72-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Jan-07</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Sigil Games Online </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,MassivelyMultiplayerOnline,MassivelyMultiplayer,Fantasy,Fantasy</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>T</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>68.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>77.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The slower progression, group focus and huge world all set the game apart from the current MMO behemoth, World of Warcraft.

The scope and depth of its simulation is remarkable. I would need to double the length of this review just to explain the enormity of it in full. And that's only outdone by the fact that it actually runs well. I wish there was a fair bit less overall jank and weird AI behavior taking me out of the illusion, and the warfare system feels very work-in-progress.

Its superb, photo-based environmental deformation doesnt just break ground  it bends and stretches it into entirely new shapes and forms in the wake of each puzzle completed, while also introducing regular game-changing parameters that forced me to continually think outside the frame of my shots. The ability to transport yourself into paintings and screenshots makes for a journey that consistently captivates in between each carefully considered camera capture, and the rapid rewind function emboldens you to get creative with puzzle solutions without fear of retribution. Spellbindingly surreal and stimulating to the end, Viewfinder is the freakiest form of photo mode in which every snap is a happy one. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Virginia</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/ae33d6a54d252aa4c6d0029e3397c1be-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>22-Sep-16</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Variable State </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Adventure,3D,First-Person</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,XboxOne,PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>74.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>5</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Virginia shows instead of tells, with a raw, understated power and a calculated nuance that make even the smallest, most mundane details brim with narrative and emotional significance. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Virtual Pool 3</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/4fce71da899404f3a08b2a63edbea210-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>14-Nov-00</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Celeris </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Sports,Miscellaneous,Parlor,Individual,Billiards,Billiards</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>E</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>82.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>85.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The physics in this game are very impressive.

While it's limited in places and the interface can struggle, the tactical combat is well worth the time it takes to learn and the Momentum system rewards your strategic prowess with more capacity to dish out pain. From the diverse campaign missions to the straightforward skirmishes, I not only recommend Battlesector, but hope that it does well enough to warrant the addition of many new factions in DLC and expansions. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Warhammer 40,000_ Boltgun</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/1077ef6c41362f5e6babc66e9ae4a503-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>23-May-23</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Auroch Digital </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,First-Person,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>75.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN France</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Boltgun perfectly aims at its nostalgic target and hit with a good game that fit well within the W40K universe. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Warhammer 40,000_ Boltgun</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/1077ef6c41362f5e6babc66e9ae4a503-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>23-May-23</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Auroch Digital </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Shooter,First-Person,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation4,PlayStation5,Switch,XboxOne,XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>75.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.3</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>70.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Boltgun impresses with Warhammer 40K chops and a fully realized vision of the famous franchise as a modern retro-shooter, light on story but heavy on action and nods to the tabletop game. The level design of its many fast-paced arena fights is enjoyable, but the momentum drags once the new weapon and enemy types run out about halfway through. Nonetheless, the quality's high enough that I never got bored  but I think someone who isn't hungry for a retro-shooter or any 40K game they can get their hands on might be a bit let down. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Warhammer 40,000_ Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/92235e9e6975ff9b15607026f3a87e0f-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>5-May-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Complex Games Inc. </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Turn-Based,Real-Time,Tactics</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>81.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>7.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters is an excellent XCOM-like and one of the best 40K games since Dawn of War II.  </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Warhammer 40,000_ Darktide</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/f6db1665741187d5bc05d9f8016b82bf-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>30-Nov-22</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Fatshark </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,General,Action,Shooter,First-Person,Arcade</Genre><Platforms>XboxSeriesX,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>74.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>80.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is, without question, the most entertaining co-op FPS I've played since Left 4 Dead 2. That careful balancing act between multiple methods of murder is ceaselessly entertaining, especially while hatching diabolical plans with your buddies to silence whatever horrors lurk in Tertium's plague-ridden streets. Tedious between-mission progression and persistent framerate dips are the only things that can occasionally spoil that fun, which is a shame when Darktide otherwise nails virtually every fundamental of its genre. Regardless, I firmly believe anyone with even the mildest interest in crushing unholy dissidents under a half-ton boot should try it out for themselves. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Warhammer 40,000_ Dawn of War - Dark Crusade</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/d1fa31d779b529ade7369663aa9efa78-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>9-Oct-06</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Relic, Relic Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>87.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.8</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>87.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  The campaign mode is absolutely interesting and fits wonderfully within the Warhammer 40,000 universe.

Its single-player campaign is long and challenging, but feels uninspired because it rarely makes creative use of the three factions abilities. In multiplayer its even more demanding and intimidatingly chaotic, but with only one mode and not a lot of maps, it seems limited. Relic deserves credit for not simply remaking the same game with prettier graphics, but this hybrid approach doesnt feel as strong as Dawn of War 2s memorable tactical focus. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Warhammer 40,000_ Dawn of War II</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/9019e1e68e39afb6fb19d16f4513e953-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>18-Feb-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Relic, Relic Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>85.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.1</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>90.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  While the overall formula could still use some fine-tuning, the current product is one part hypercharged tactical combat, one part streamlined competitive RTS, and entirely worth playing. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Warhammer 40,000_ Dawn of War</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/aa001c1b883880267fc49997edd53eb6-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>20-Sep-04</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Relic, Relic Entertainment </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Strategy,Real-Time,Sci-Fi,Sci-Fi,General</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>86.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>8.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>88.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It isn't that Dawn of War does anything extraordinarily new or brilliant in terms of gameplay mechanics, but the battles are just so damn entertaining and the pace of the game fast enough that it's hard not to have a good time. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Warhammer 40,000_ Eternal Crusade</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/f99dcf99a37f200a98fd6e8f976dea7c-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>23-Sep-16</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Behaviour Interactive Inc., Behaviour Interactive </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Role-Playing,MassivelyMultiplayer</Genre><Platforms>PC</Platforms><OverallMetascore>52.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>4.7</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>53.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  It currently doesn't offer the amount of content Id expect from a $50 game.

Theres enough variety in the way different characters play to make that a good tradeoff for not having one traditionally progressing character with a fleshed-out personality, and playing with permadeath enabled ratchets up the tension of infiltrating heavily guarded areas. On top of that, the map is detailed and loaded with environmental puzzles to solve with a little help from your drones. Legion is technically a little rough, but its sandbox-style approach is a good idea that sets Watch Dogs moment-to-moment gameplay even further apart from the GTA series. </ReviewText></item><item><GameTitle>Watchmen_ The End Is Nigh</GameTitle><GamePoster>https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/a78a3154483520467b1931021f79eb24-98.jpg</GamePoster><GameReleaseDate>4-Mar-09</GameReleaseDate><GameDeveloper>Deadline Games </GameDeveloper><Genre>Genre(s):Action,Beat-'Em-Up,Beat-'Em-Up,2D</Genre><Platforms>PlayStation3,Xbox360,PC</Platforms><ProductRating>M</ProductRating><OverallMetascore>61.0</OverallMetascore><OverallUserRating>6.9</OverallUserRating><ReviewerName>IGN</ReviewerName><ReviewerType>Critic</ReviewerType><RatingGivenByTheReviewer>55.0</RatingGivenByTheReviewer><ReviewText>  Though the very idea of a Watchmen brawler may sicken some, this could have been a good game.

Playing through its five stories and reaching their collective conclusion produces a wagonload of bizarre encounters, twists, and reveals, and its stealth and chaotic combat are challenging but come with the built-in safety nets of unlimited slow-motion and an old-school quickload system.

It doesnt completely fumble the joy of its weapons and abilities or counteract the pleasing sensation of squishing Nazis between your toes, but it does make it harder to enjoy at seemingly every turn with an out-of-place leveling system, busted stealth gameplay, some aggravating boss fights and inadequate checkpoint saves.
